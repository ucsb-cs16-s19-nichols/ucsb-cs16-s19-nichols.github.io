* Separate compilation with Makefiles [read about Makefile](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/16wiki/index.php/C%2B%2B:_Separate_Compilation_and_Makefiles)

## Data and number representation

* Positional encoding: binary, hex, decimal
* Internal vs. external representation
* Conversion between different representations
* Key ideas: bits can represent ANYTHING. With n bits we can represent at most 2^N things
* Apply above rule to represent characters (ASCII), unicode, colors ....
* The data type of a variable determines its representation in memory AND the number of bits used to store each variable
