# Topics

## Code from lecture
<https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f18-nichols/code-from-class/tree/master/10-30>

## Pointers

* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"
* Pointers and arrays - similarities and dfferences
* Passing arrays to functions - specifically looking at how arrays degnerate to pointers on function calls.


## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by address
